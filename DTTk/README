Guide - Guide to the DTraceToolkit

    How to get started, and a table of contents.

	1. The top most useful scripts are in this directory.
	2. Try running them with "-h". Eg, "./execsnoop -h".
	3. read Docs/Contents for a full list of scripts.

Not-so-QuickStart
	
	1. Welcome!
	2. Check the Table of Contents below to become famaliar with the
	   directory structure of the DTraceToolkit.
	3. see Docs/Faq for any initial questions.
	4. read Docs/Contents for a list of scripts.
	5. read Docs/Readme to see where scripts are documented.
	6. check Docs/Links for further DTrace.
	7. Once famaliar with the toolkit, the following may be useful to
	   add to your shell initialisation file,
		PATH=$PATH:/opt/DTT/Bin
		MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/DTT/Man
	   in this case assuming the toolkit was installed in /opt/DTT.

Installation

	1. Run ./install
	   This will replace any existing version of the DTraceToolkit
	   with this one. It will prompt. Final install location is
	   printed by this install script.

When you type ls in the DTraceToolkit, you will be looking at the top ten 
or so most useful scripts. Other scripts have been placed in meaningful
subdirectories, such as Disk, Kernel, Proc, etc. An optional Bin directory
has been provided that links to all the scripts.

The DTraceToolkit is released under the CDDL license. It's the same freeware 
license that OpenSolaris has been released under.

Thank you for using the DTraceToolkit!
